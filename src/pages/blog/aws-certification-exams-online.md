description: My lessons learned after sitting some online proctored AWS Certification exams this year
---

In the first half of 2020 [AWS announced](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/aws-certification-exams-now-available-virtually-for-added-convenience-and-flexibility/) that all of its certification exams were to be available virtually via online proctoring.

I had already taken two AWS certification exams using the regular onsite proctoring service at a PSI office and as you might expect - the exams were conducted in strictly controlled, supervised environment. So I was super curious to see how this could be replicated at home with a remote service.

Given that we were still under lockdown conditions, I thought that working towards a new qualification would provide new and welcome, mental stimulation and a tangible goal for maximum motivation. So I decided to try it out.

I decided on the DevOps Professional and Security Specialty, as they were most relevant to the work I normally do as a Cloud Engineer and DevOps practitioner.

This post is about my experience of taking the exam at home versus in an exam centre and how you might prepare yourself well in light of my experience.

## Book the exam

Booking the exam was straightforward and the same as the onsite exams I had taken previously. There were exam slots available 24/7 which is convenient.

## Don't believe everything you read

Just as I was done booking my first exam and beginning to get excited about it, I started to read some worrying stories about folks experiences with the at-home exam procedure on the AWS reddit and some other social media.

I am happy to say though - I had a good experience. Everything was reliable, the proctors were on time and I was never waiting around. Hopefully the tips in this post will help maximise your chances of having a good experience too.

## Test your system in advance

Sitting AWS exams online requires installation of the [Pearson OnVUE](https://home.pearsonvue.com/Test-takers/OnVUE-online-proctoring.aspx) software.

The OnVUE software basically takes over your computer once launched and provides the interface within which the exam content is delivered.

You will have the opportunity to run a system test with the OnVue software in the days prior to the exam taking place - I would urge you to take advantage of this and try the software at least 48 hours in advance of your exam.

The system test will highlight any issues on the system you are using to take the exam, and give you enough time to reschedule if something goes wrong, without losing your exam fee.

## Prepare your environment in advance

This part was a little painful for me!

At home, my 'office' room doubles as a studio where I do audio production work and of course recording equipment, mics and such are going to be a potential concern to an exam proctor concerned with keeping exam content secure.

To avoid any possible friction I just bit the bullet and cleared **everything** out, leaving just my desk and chair behind. My hallway was full of stuff for a couple of days but it was worth it for peace of mind.

Be sure to check the [Pearson Testing Advice](https://home.pearsonvue.com/aws/onvue) page for full details and err on the site of caution if you are unsure.

## On exam day

The first step is to "check-in" with your online proctor.. but before you do that -

1. Have a _small_ drink of water
2. Go to the bathroom

Do this in the knowledge that you won't be allowed to have anything to eat, drink or leave the room once the exam has started.

During the check-in process, I was asked to use my phone to take photos of the room where I was taking the exam, and submit the photos to a website where the photos would be inspected by a proctor.

I also had to lift my laptop off the desk and use the webcam to scan the room 360 degrees, including under my desk. The proctors are nothing if not thorough!

After this - it is time for the exam to begin.

## Final thoughts

You will at know immediately following the exam whether you passed or failed, but it can take a couple of days for your actual score to arrive.

The Professional exams in particular take a long time and I was getting uncomfortable towards the end. This and having to clean all the electronics out of your room are probably the only downsides of taking an exam at home.

I hope this was of some help to anyone thinking of taking exams using the online service. Thanks for reading and best of luck with your exams!

description: The best sources for keeping up with the rapid rate of change in AWS
---

Such is the rate of change in AWS, it is a full time task just keeping track of updates to the services and features that are important to you.

Keep yourself ahead of the game by checking out these recommended sources!

## General AWS News

Starting with the obvious - the [AWS What’s New](https://aws.amazon.com/new) page and [RSS Feed](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/recent/feed/) is essentially a news feed of release notes for new services and new features.

If you prefer your news via Twitter, the bot [What’s New on AWS (Unofficial)](https://twitter.com/awswhatsnew) publishes content from the official AWS What’s New RSS Feed to Twitter.

Decidedly different to the AWS What’s New page, the [AWS News Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/) is a regularly updated source of longer-form articles about new services and features.

The AWS News Blog can be really useful if you are looking to get started with a new service or feature just after launch. The posts generally offer a lot more context about how to utilise the service to fulfil an example use case.

If you don't have time to read everything posted on the AWS News Blog, selectively reading just the posts tagged [Week in Review](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/tag/week-in-review) will provide you with a single-page summary of the new stuff every week.

## CloudFormation News

If you use CloudFormation, no doubt you have been caught out by a new feature launch that did not have CloudFormation support out-the-box. Inexplicably, this _is_ still a thing..

You can at least find out asap when support for that new feature launches by following the [CloudFormation Release Notes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-cloudformation-release-notes.rss) RSS Feed.

If you prefer to keep up with news the Twitter way, [CFN Updates](https://mobile.twitter.com/cfnupdates) is a bot that automatically publishes new content from the CloudFormation release notes.

## AWS API Changes

For APIs specifically, you can keep track of new methods released across all AWS APIs with this handy site: [AWS API Changes (Unofficial)](https://awsapichanges.info/).

## AWS Twitter

AWS senior staff frequently post useful information on Twitter:

- AWS CTO [Werner Vogels](https://twitter.com/Werner)
- AWS Chief Evangelist [Jeff Barr](https://twitter.com/jeffbarr)
- AWS Chief Evangelist (EMEA) [Danilo Poccia](https://twitter.com/danilop)

There are _loads_ of useful AWS Twitter accounts, these are just my must-follows.

Many of the AWS Services have a dedicated Twitter e.g. [CloudFormation](https://twitter.com/AWSCloudFormer), [AWS Identity](https://twitter.com/AWSIdentity), but in my experience there is a lot of overlap between them and the news sources already mentioned here so I tend to not follow them.

## Roadmaps

AWS' own John Culkin maintains the [Unofficial list of public AWS roadmaps](https://github.com/johnculkin/UnofficialListOfPublicAWSRoadmaps).

The public [CloudFormation Coverage Roadmap](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-coverage-roadmap/projects/1) is great for tracking where that missing feature support is in the release schedule.

This degree of transparency from AWS has been really welcome. I find it super useful when you are trying to work out if a fix or feature is in the pipeline, and you can read the discourse around it.

Hope this was useful. Thanks for reading!

description: A review of what I did this past year and what's next in the pipeline
---

On this day, one year ago - I published my first blog post.

This was not a momentous achievement by any means, blogs are mainstream and ten-a-penny these days! But taking into account the turmoil in my life (bereavement, pandemic, house fire) I am satisfied to have achieved at least some goals in 2021.

## 2021 Achievements

These were my goals involving the blog in 2021.

- [x] Launch blog
- [x] Post something every month
- [x] Improve my writing
- [x] Evolve the blog platform

It is tough to say objectively that my writing improved - it is _my_ writing after all, so I am not best placed to judge it. But I think I did improve and I certainly feel more comfortable 'writing in public'.

Regarding the blog platform - I launched the blog self-hosted in AWS using Hugo. The theme at the time was a minimalistic one, loosely based on the design of [Medium](https://medium.com/).

As the year progressed, I experimented with Medium and Hashnode, before recently settling on Gatsby which is what the blog is running on right now.

I am pleased with the styling of the blog at least, which is a modified version of [Gatsby Casper](https://github.com/scttcper/gatsby-casper). I see this blog as primarily a platform for learning though, and that includes developing the blog platform so I am sure things will change again soon enough!

## Plans for 2022

### Goals

- Post more often - I would like to be posting twice a month by end 2022.
- Evolve the blog platform. I am not completely happy with Gatsby. I find it 'glitchy' to work with - the image integration gives me funny results at times and it just feels a little heavyweight and slow. I have my eye on Astro which looks _very_ interesting and like a more modern component based version of Hugo.
- Engagement. I purposely did not add e.g. a subscription newsletter feature during the first year until I had a feel for blogging. I would like some feedback features though.

### New Topics

- AWS CDK. I anticipate switching from vanilla CloudFormation to AWS CDK in 2022. I aim to post regularly about CDK and establish a public repository of example CDK patterns, constructs and snippets.
- TypeScript. Post about learning TypeScript. This goes hand in hand with switching to CDK as my primary Infrastructure as Code tool as TypeScript is the _true_ first class citizen in the CDK ecosystem.
- Side Projects. I have a couple of side projects in development that I will post about.

Here's to 2022 - **let's go!**

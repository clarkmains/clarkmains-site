> You Now Have a Shorter Attention Span Than a Goldfish - [Time magazine](https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish)

Clickbait? Probably.. but [studies do suggest](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/582196) that not only is our inability to focus a real thing, it is actually a result of human evolution and our natural state.

> "Attention is fluid, and you want it to be fluid," said Fiebelkorn. "You don't want to be over-locked on anything. It seems like it's an evolutionary advantage to have these windows of opportunity where you're checking in with your environment."

As developers, this trait is at odds with our need to concentrate on singular complex tasks like writing or debugging for extended periods of time.

So what can we do to help improve our focus? Get in a flow state.

## Flow state

If you are not familiar with the term [flow state](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)>) you may recognise the concept by another name - being "in the zone".

A state of flow is the feeling of being so fully immersed in a task that making progress seems effortless and you lose track of time and your environment.

If we can encourage this state on-demand then it follows that productivity and even quality of output, may improve. Let's look at one strategy that may help.

## Encouraging a state of flow

The archetypal _i'm-concentrating-with-headphones-on_ developer could be on to something.. assuming your work environment allows - listening to music may indeed be the lowest-hanging fruit with respect to improving your ability to focus on the task at hand.

Numerous experimental studies have been carried out in this area:

- [These are the best music types to engage your brain](https://www.studyinternational.com/news/best-music-to-study-with)
- [When music 'flows'. A systematic review](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-55534-001)
- [Benefits of music for studying](https://www.healthline.com/health/does-music-help-you-study#benefits-of-music-for-studying)

Anecdotally I would agree as I have found my ability to focus benefits greatly from listening to certain types of music.

I find it is nuanced though. I prefer ambient and classical music, I find vocals are distracting, and mixes i.e. without gaps between tracks, work best.

## Curated music

A fantastic curated resource I have found is the website [Music for Programming](https://musicforprogramming.net).

> A series of mixes intended for listening while ${task} to focus the brain and inspire the mind.

At time of writing there are 45 hours of music for programming here.

The site is beautifully designed, by musician and developer [datassette](https://twitter.com/datassette).

In terms of my own favourites - I find the following ambient and dub-leaning long-players some of the best pieces of music for focus:

- Voices from the Lake - [self-titled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIMm0swerow)
- Global Communication - [76:14](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL038F64AA82020193)
- Yagya - [Rigning](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lS_6Ci-XQiW9dEgaVKGgq1W7VNU7raMb8)
- Aphex Twin - [Selected Ambient Works II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-57Ti2i_yhU)

## Generative music

Generative music services offer an alternative approach.

The music generated by these services is often made up of samples of human-played instruments or even snippets of human compositions i.e. harmony and melody that is leveraged by AI to create sometimes infinite arrangements.

Probably the most well-established service in this area is [brain.fm](https://www.brain.fm/):

> Humans compose the musical content (the art: melodies, harmonies, chord progressions, sound design, instrument choices, etc.) Then, a patented algorithmic system (A.I.) arranges these motifs over long timescales, and adds the acoustic features which constitute our core technology (the science: modulation to alter brain activity, 3D spatialization, salience reduction, etc.).

A free-ish alternative I would recommend starting with is [generative.fm](https://generative.fm/) which is a pay-what-you-want service by independent developer [Alex Bainter](https://github.com/alexbainter).

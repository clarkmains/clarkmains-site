description: OverTheWire is super fun way to learn Web and Linux security concepts

[OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames) is a website that hosts a collection of what the security community call **Wargames** - scenario-oriented cybersecurity challenges.

Wargames are typically an individual pursuit, accessed on-demand and completed at your own pace. This differentiates them from CTF (Capture The Flag) events which commonly run for a limited time as a team competition.

The OverTheWire Wargames are also hands-down the most fun practical exercises I have ever participated in. OverTheWire has been around for a few years now but if you have never tried it before, you are in for a real treat!

## Why?

As the adage goes - **Security is Everyone's Job**.

The overall goal of OverTheWire is to improve your understanding of security concepts.

To succeed, you will need to cultivate a problem-solving mindset, one that is able to think laterally. This is probably the greatest gift of OverTheWire.

## How it works

You access Wargame hosts over SSH or in some cases, via a web browser.

Each Wargame has a number of levels and you must complete the current level to proceed to the next. Usually, completion of a level will result in some kind of secret being revealed and this secret is necessary to access the next level.

## Example

The suggested first Wargame is called [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).

**SPOILER ALERT!**

The first few levels of Bandit are about teaching you the absolute basics of Linux shell, commands like `cat` and `find`.

The levels do increase in difficulty but it is a gradual curve.

By the time you reach the halfway point of Bandit (level 17) you will have worked through file name issues, string encoding and the use of network utilities to scan and probe ports.

This first Wargame alone touches upon a wide array of subjects including some really useful exercises involving tracing, dependency management and debugging.

If you haven't tried them out, don't wait any longer - go have some fun and you might even learn something new in the process! Enjoy and Merry Christmas!

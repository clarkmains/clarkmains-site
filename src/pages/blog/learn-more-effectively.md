description: Use evidence-based techniques to learn and retain more knowledge
---

During lockdown I sat and thankfully passed some [AWS Certification Exams](https://www.credly.com/users/clark-mains/badges) using the recently introduced online proctoring option.

In preparation for the exams, I implemented an evidence-based strategy to studying which has served me well since then. As a career in tech means being a life-long learner, I thought this might make for an interesting post.

All the resources I mention here are open-source or free for personal use.

## Learning How to Learn

The Coursera course [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) was my starting point.

I had seen this course mentioned in dispatches many times on social media and it was an ideal way to research which techniques and tools might be most helpful in establishing an effective learning strategy.

I found the course really interesting with many useful and actionable takeaways. One I really liked was the revelation that the brain has two learning modes:

1. Focused - when you are actively learning something new
2. Diffused - when you are doing something else and your subconscious is forming connections between your existing and new knowledge

This helps explain why the answer to a problem you've been actively thinking about for a while just seems to materialise out of nowhere when you decide to take a break from focusing on the issue and make a coffee!

The course also covered techniques I was aware of but not using regularly:

- Pomodoro
- Active Recall
- Spaced Repetition

## My strategy

After digesting everything from the course, my strategy was becoming clear:

1. Use Pomodoro technique to implement small-chunking while studying - helps maintain focus and beat procrastination
2. Adopt Active Recall in my study notes instead of summarising content to be passively reviewed - solidifies understanding of concepts
3. Implement Spaced Repetition - increases long-term retention of key information

### Pomodoro Technique

The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that the inventor [Francesco Cirillo used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

There are six steps in the original technique:

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally for 25 minutes).
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (traditionally 5 to 10 minutes).
5. If you have done fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat.
6. After three pomodoros are done, take a long break (traditionally 20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break is finished, repeat the entire loop.

In practice, while I _do_ regularly use a Pomodoro timer app while studying, I do not _rigidly_ adhere to the traditional 25 minute interval of doing work. For example - when studying a video course, a break following each video chapter might be most appropriate.

The key takeaway here is: regular breaks are critical to productivity.

Once you break down a long task into small chunks and use Pomodoro technique to work through those chunks, you will be amazed at how much you can get done without it seeming a chore.

### Active Recall

[Active Recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall) is the act of retrieving information from memory during revision, rather than just passively reviewing what you have written.

In practice this can be achieved by phrasing parts of your notes in a Q+A format.

This means you are constantly performing mini-tests when revising your notes as opposed to just reading text as you would do during a passive review.

I use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for note taking. Notion it has a handy 'toggle' feature that allows you to hide a block of text until the toggle is collapsed.

My strategy was is to intersperse my notes with Q+A sections for key points that I was likely to be tested on, or that I had trouble recalling for whatever reason:

### Spaced Repetition

The final piece of the puzzle is [Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).

Spaced Repetition is a form of active recall using [flashcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard) and it has been proven to increase the rate of learning. Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect.

The reigning champion of Spaced Repetition apps is [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net).

Anki keeps track of the ideal time to review material and optimizes itself based on your feedback as every time you answer a question on a flashcard you tell Anki how well you were able to remember the answer.

Anki uses this feedback to decide the optimal time to show you the flashcard again.

As part of my strategy, I create a flashcard in Anki for each of the Active Recall Q+A blocks in my Notion notes on a subject. I then use Anki daily to review any flashcards that are due according to Anki's algorithm.

### Final thoughts

This strategy has proven to be very effective for me and I continue to practice it daily as I am constantly learning new things.

One thing I am considering is the use of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) in place of Notion, as I would prefer to keep the data from my notes under my own control and synced to a git repository for backup. Watch this space for more on Obsidian in the future.

Thanks for reading, I hope you found this useful!

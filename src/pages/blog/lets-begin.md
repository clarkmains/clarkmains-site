## Why blog?

My overarching goal is to help keep my technical skills fluent.

I am currently on a caregiving break and I see blogging as part of a strategy to help maintain my skills by writing about any technical work I do while I am unable to commit to full time employment.

And if I achieve my goal of writing at least one new post per month, I hope the practice of blogging may actually _improve_ at least one skill - my writing.

Ultimately, I would also like to do some streaming and build more things in public. I see blogging as a good first step to becoming more confident about doing such things.

## Subjects

I will primarily cover topics related to the Cloud and Software Engineering:

- Exploring AWS new tools, services and features
- Developing solutions in the Cloud
- DevOps practices such as Infrastructure as Code
- Security and SecOps
- Python development

Other things that I may post about:

- Audio production
- Creative coding
- Productivity

**Let's begin.**

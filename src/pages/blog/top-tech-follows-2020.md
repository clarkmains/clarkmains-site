description: Some of my favourite content creators from the world of tech in 2020
---

There was no shortage of time to consume content during lockdown in 2020.. sometimes it even stretched beyond Netflix!

In the world of tech though - these were my favourite social follows and content creators in 2020!

## Julia Evans

[Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca) is I think as close to rock star status in the sphere of tech social media as you can get.

Julia's blog is a consistent source of in-depth but extremely readable technical articles and the long-form [zines](https://wizardzines.com/) are a particular favourite of mine and great value.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I put up a bunch of my favourite pages from my zines at <a href="https://t.co/v6Wu3hG8IF">https://t.co/v6Wu3hG8IF</a> <a href="https://t.co/ZkOGqjefGV">pic.twitter.com/ZkOGqjefGV</a></p>&mdash; üîéJulia Evansüîç (@b0rk) <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1280487572066701313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 7, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<br/>

Julia also makes many shorter zines available for free. The [tcpdump](https://wizardzines.com/zines/tcpdump/) and [Linux debugging tools](https://wizardzines.com/zines/debugging/) zines are fantastic.

## Cloudonaut

[Cloudonaut](https://cloudonaut.io) are Andreas & Michael Wittig of [AWS in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/amazon-web-services-in-action) fame.

These two brothers are authors and consultants who focus 100% on AWS, run an interesting technical blog and host the [Cloudonaut Podcast](https://podcast.cloudonaut.io) which publishes every couple of weeks and has quite a novel format -

> Every other week, one of us prepares the topic of the podcast. The topic is not known to the other one, which results in surprising conversations about all things AWS.

A Cloudonaut highlight for me was a [blog post](https://blog.cloudcraft.co/co-footprint-of-your-architecture) discussing how AWS aims to achieve 100% renewable energy for its data centers and a reminder to everyone that CO¬≤ footprint should be a factor when designing your next AWS architecture.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When designing an architecture, there are many factors to consider: security, reliability, performance and costs. I‚Äôd like to add another one: the CO¬≤ footprint. <a href="https://t.co/JcdCiVAHoo">https://t.co/JcdCiVAHoo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/awscommunity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#awscommunity</a> <a href="https://t.co/Bgy556CFdU">pic.twitter.com/Bgy556CFdU</a></p>&mdash; Andreas Wittig (@andreaswittig) <a href="https://twitter.com/andreaswittig/status/1332425992904843267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It is so good to see influential voices focused on environmental issues.

I hope AWS will explicitly create a section calling out Sustainability in the Performance Efficiency part of the [Well Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html) soon.

## Eric Johnson

[Eric Johnson](https://twitter.com/edjgeek) is a Developer Advocate at AWS.

I know Eric best for his assocation with AWS SAM and the [Serverless Land](https://www.youtube.com/c/ServerlessLand) YouTube channel. The Serverless Land website brings together all the latest [blogs](https://serverlessland.com/blog), [videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/ServerlessLand), and training for AWS Serverless.

![Serverless Land](/images/top-tech-follows-2020/serverlessland.jpg)

One of my favourite Serverless Land videos in 2020 was [Fundamentals of Amazon DynamoDB Single Table Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYy8X8t4MB8) which had a guest host - DynamoDB legend Rick Houlihan - extremely insightful viewing and highly recommended!

## Real Python

Real Python is my favourite resource for learning about Python.

The [Real Python website](https://realpython.com/) is a commercial venture with tutorial videos and such, but much of the written content is generously available for free. There is a lot of consistently high quality content, nicely organised and all of the content creators seem very well versed.

The Real Python [Podcast](https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/) launched in March this year, around the time of the first lockdown. I'm not sure if that was coincidental but its arrival was very welcome!

One of my favourite episodes was "Episode 33: Going Beyond the Basic Stuff With Python and Al Sweigart".

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">üêçüéß The Real Python Podcast (Episode 41) ‚Äî 2020 Real Python Articles in Review<br><br>The Real Python team has produced a mountain of Python articles this year. We also upgraded the site and membership with office hours, transcripts, this podcast, and more.<a href="https://t.co/taB7ZLhhqn">https://t.co/taB7ZLhhqn</a> <a href="https://t.co/Ur62FFstX8">pic.twitter.com/Ur62FFstX8</a></p>&mdash; Real Python (@realpython) <a href="https://twitter.com/realpython/status/1344468327733862403?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I really enjoyed hearing the author's story as "Automate the Boring Stuff" is such a legendary Python book. I haven't picked up Al's new book [Beyond the Basic Stuff With Python: Best Practices for Writing Clean Code](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Beyond-Basics-Al-Sweigart/dp/1593279663) yet but I look forward to doing so!

## Jeremy Daly

I first discovered Jeremy a couple of years ago via his great blog post [Serverless Microservice Patterns for AWS](https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-microservice-patterns-for-aws/). It is a great read and was so helpful in improving my understanding of Serverless architectures.

In addition to a blog, Jeremy curates a serverless-focused weekly newsletter [Off-by-none](https://offbynone.io/) that always offers some useful nuggets and a fantastic podcast [Serverless Chats](https://www.serverlesschats.com/) that publishes every two weeks.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Episode #81: The Best of 2020 is now available! Watch on YouTube or listen with your favorite podcast app! üéß Wishing you all a very happy, healthy, and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/serverless?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#serverless</a> 2021! üçæ <a href="https://t.co/5ZVvjTrAVK">https://t.co/5ZVvjTrAVK</a></p>&mdash; Serverless Chats Podcast (@ServerlessChats) <a href="https://twitter.com/ServerlessChats/status/1343563427927748609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

If you aren't already familiar with the podcast, there are loads of episodes to catch up on. A good place to begin might be [Episode #81: The Best of 2020](https://www.serverlesschats.com/81/).

My list definitely trends toward those with Podcasts as I have listened to a **lot** of them during lockdown. I hope you found something new here that you enjoy!

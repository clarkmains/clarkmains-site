description: Some of my favourite content creators in the world of tech in 2021
---

Want some ideas on new creators to follow? You came to the right place! These lovely people are my favourite tech follows and content creators of 2021.

## Yan Cui

My first follow of 2021 is Yan Cui aka [The Burning Monk](https://theburningmonk.com/).

Yan has some of the best AWS Serverless content around. In addition to a prolific [twitter](https://twitter.com/theburningmonk), Yan has a fantastic [blog](https://theburningmonk.com/) and some incredible training courses like [Production Ready Serverless](https://productionreadyserverless.com/) that can be taken in person or online.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How to think about Lambda cold starts <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/aws?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#aws</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/serverless?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#serverless</a> <a href="https://t.co/7dKGT8oX90">pic.twitter.com/7dKGT8oX90</a></p>&mdash; Yan Cui (@theburningmonk) <a href="https://twitter.com/theburningmonk/status/1419657782740008963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<br />

There is also the second edition of the fantastic [Serverless Architectures on AWS](https://www.manning.com/books/serverless-architectures-on-aws-second-edition) book, currently in MEAP.

What I appreciate most about Yan's content is the focus on real world scenarios - what you learn is truly applicable to production.

Yan also publishes the [Real-World Serverless Podcast](https://twitter.com/RealWorldSls). I really enjoyed [Talking DynamoDB with Alex DeBrie](https://realworldserverless.com/episode/52) but honestly - just check out everything Yan does, it is all awesome!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Check out the latest ep of <a href="https://twitter.com/RealWorldSls?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RealWorldSls</a> where I spoke with <a href="https://twitter.com/alexbdebrie?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@alexbdebrie</a> on all things DynamoDB!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/serverless?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#serverless</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/aws?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#aws</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dynamodb?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#dynamodb</a><a href="https://t.co/zNQld94mrA">https://t.co/zNQld94mrA</a></p>&mdash; Yan Cui (@theburningmonk) <a href="https://twitter.com/theburningmonk/status/1389892786950901761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 5, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<br />

## aws.fm / Adam Elmore

I love podcasts and the [aws.fm](https://aws.fm/) podcast is **outstanding**!

The person behind the podcast is developer [Adam Elmore](https://twitter.com/aeduhm).

The aws.fm podcast only started mid 2021 but has published high quality episodes at such a terrific rate (sometimes 4 a week!) that I have to recommended it here.

Episode 10 with AWS Serverless Hero [Luc van Donkersgoed](https://twitter.com/donkersgood) was a definite highlight.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Episode 10 w/ <a href="https://twitter.com/donkersgood?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@donkersgood</a> is available wherever you listen to podcasts!<br><br>We discussed our combined 24 AWS certifications, his AWS Hero cape, and, ofc, canoes ðŸ›¶ ðŸ˜‚ <a href="https://t.co/N5Onjst55X">https://t.co/N5Onjst55X</a> <a href="https://t.co/sS4e05siUc">pic.twitter.com/sS4e05siUc</a></p>&mdash; AWS FM (@_awsfm) <a href="https://twitter.com/_awsfm/status/1450079383612448770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2021</a></blockquote>  <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<br />

Adam was also recently a guest on the [Serverless Chats](https://www.serverlesschats.com/120/) podcast hosted by Jeremy Daly who was one of my top follows of 2020 and of course still a recommendation! I highly recommend checking out this podcast too if you can.

## Corey Quinn

[Last Week in AWS](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/) is an independent newsletter by Cloud Economist [Corey Quinn](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig). Corey does not pull his punches and offers a refreshing, humorous and sometimes scathing take on what's going on in the AWS ecosystem.

Of course inkeeping with the theme of this post so far - there is a Podcast!

Subtitled "The AWS Morning show you never knew you wanted", Corey publishes the [AWS MORNING BRIEF](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/aws-morning-brief/) most days on Apple Podcasts et al.

I heartily recommend but brace yourself for "the snark" :laughing:

## Alex Xu

[Alex Xu](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte) is a specialist in explaining the design of complex systems via easy to understand architecture diagrams and infographics.

Alex' book [System Design Interview](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08B3FWYBX/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0) is fantastic - check out Alex' twitter feed too though as he posts some amazing stuff there on a daily basis!

<br />

## Shawn Wang (Swyx)

[Shawn Wang](https://twitter.com/swyx) is a really interesting follow. And hard to sum up - so let's just say Shawn is a blogger, developer and author for now.

At Shawn's website [Swyx](https://www.swyx.io/) you will find the focus of the site, the [Idea Showcase](https://www.swyx.io/ideas). There is a terrific variety of content here - tutorials, opinion pieces and more cerebral stuff like his talk [The Operating System of You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzK4IxHv3W0).

It is these more philosophical and strategic writings that stand out to me most in Shawn's writing - posts like [How to Create Luck](https://www.swyx.io/create-luck) and [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) are fantastic reads.

Shawn also has a really interesting back story that he talks about in an episode of the [freeCodeCamp Podcast](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/shawn-wang-podcast-interview/). Highly recommended!

That's it for 2021! I hope you found something new here that you enjoy!
